# Chris Jobling's Stories

This is an archive of the tweet chat stories that I originally created on [Storify](https://storify.com) ([storify.com/cpjobling](https://storify.com/cpjobling)] between July 2014 and December 2017. I created it as a response to the announcement that Storify service was being retired in May 2018.

![A screenshot of my Storify archive at it was on 21st December 2017](cpj-at-storify.png).

## How I made this

Storify has provided an export feature which is able to save a published story as HTML5, XML or JSON. I used the HTML5 option which creates a single web page with the images, styles and JavaScript embedded then used my browser's *Save page as Webpage, complete* feature to create a complete local copy of the page and all its assets.

I created a new public project on GitHub ([https://github.com/cpjobling/stories](github.com/cpjobling/stories)) and used the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) feature to create a static website repository of these saved stories that is accessible via [cpjobling.github.io/stories](https://cpjobling.github.io/stories).

By archiving a couple of handfuls of stories per session, the whole process took a few days.

Furthermore, the beauty of using Git is that the whole archive is just a set of files on my PC and I can create numerous copies. So there's no danger of losing the archive, even GitHub shuts down. Plus the archive, in the `gh-pages` branch of the [https://github.com/cpjobling/stories](github.com/cpjobling/stories) repository, is just a static website and can be hosted on any server. Git provides version control and support for distributed replication.

## What's next

I've demonstrated a solution to the archiving of a set of stories but the solution to the problem of curation of tweet chats is still open.
